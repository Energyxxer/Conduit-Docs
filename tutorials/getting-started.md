# Getting Started

## Creating a Project
Create a new project via `File > New > Conduit Project`. Enter the name of the project and press Enter.

It will set you up with a project that contains:
  * A behavior pack with a manifest.json
  * A resource pack with a manifest.json
  * A single script that logs "Hello World"
